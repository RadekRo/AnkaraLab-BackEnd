## About

The AnkaraLab Back-End application is engineered to support the core functionalities of a digital printing house's online platform. It encompasses comprehensive management of user accounts, product catalog exposition, and the order processing system. Through the use of advanced technologies and frameworks, it ensures a seamless and secure connection with the Microsoft SQL Server database, facilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. This application acts as the backbone of the platform, connecting with the Front-End via RESTful APIs to provide a cohesive and integrated user experience.

## Technologies

The development of the AnkaraLab Back-End application employs a suite of technologies designed for high performance and reliability:

- **C#:** A versatile, object-oriented programming language used to implement the application's logic and backend services.
- **SQL:** Utilized for database management, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation within the Microsoft SQL Server.
- **REST API:** Enables seamless communication between the Front-End and Back-End, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface by facilitating data exchange in a structured format.

## Integration

The Back-End application is a critical component of the AnkaraLab platform, providing the necessary infrastructure for the front-end application to operate effectively. It ensures data consistency, security, and the execution of complex business logic required for managing user accounts, product information, and orders. This integration is pivotal for maintaining the overall integrity and performance of the platform.

## Testing

To ensure the reliability and performance of the AnkaraLab Back-End, comprehensive tests are conducted. These tests are available in a separate repository:

- **Repository for Tests:** [AnkaraLab-Backend.Tests](https://github.com/RadekRo/AnkaraLab-Backend.Tests)

The testing suite covers unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests, ensuring each component of the Back-End application performs as expected and adheres to the highest standards of quality.
